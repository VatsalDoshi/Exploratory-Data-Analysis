In this Jupyter Notebook, I have explored and analyzed a given dataset using Python programming language. 

I started by importing the necessary libraries such as numpy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, plotly and others. 

Then, I loaded the dataset and dropped irrelevant columns to clean the data and make it ready for analysis. 

I have also checked the dataset's information to get an understanding of the data types, null values and other statistical measures. 

Lastly, I have performed data visualization using various visualization tools like bar plots, scatter plots, heatmaps, and more to gain insights and make meaningful conclusions from the data. 

The results and analysis from this project can be found in the Jupyter Notebook and can be replicated and extended for further research and analysis.
